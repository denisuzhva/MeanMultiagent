I. Propagate to all neighbors
	* PROPAGATE NA->EA
	* PROPAGATE EA->{NA: NA belongs to N_i}
	* Calculate alpha * sum diff = prop

II. Proose to all neighbors
	* PROPOSE p NA->EA
	* For each NA EA checks if its N_i needs PROPOSE from the NA
	* EA sends prop to {NA: NA belongs to N_i} until no one needs it anymore or prop reaches 0
	* If prop != 0 then REJECT_PROPOSAL EA->NA
