# MeanMultiagent
A multiagent system that calculates an average value of agent state with DFS (centralized network) and local voting protocol (decentralized network).
For more information regarding the local voting, see https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271427886_Local_voting_protocol_in_decentralized_load_balancing_problem_with_switched_topology_noise_and_delays

The multiagent network is implemented using the JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment) framework.
